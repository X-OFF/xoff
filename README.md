Xamarin Offline First Framework for syncing data between rest services and local storage methods (sqlite, realm, etc.)

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the project in Zip format.
2. Open the solution in VS for Mac 
3. Set Examples/OfflineFirstReferenceArch.iOS as Startup project.
4. Rebuild All
5. Run the app in an iPhone Simulator 

Note: While the app is being run in simulator, the connectivity might not be updated correctly when the machine's network status changes (for testing purpose). In that case, hit stop debugging and run again to make sure connectivity status gets updated.
